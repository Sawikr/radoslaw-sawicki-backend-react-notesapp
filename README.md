## Application description
NotesApp is a REST API based application. This is an application for creating, editing, deleting and emailing personal notes.
The application also includes current exchange rates and weather forecast.

## Launching the application
NotesApp is deployed at: [https://sawikr.github.io/radoslaw-sawicki-frontend-react-notesapp/](https://sawikr.github.io/radoslaw-sawicki-frontend-react-notesapp/).
In order to log in to the application, you need a username and password. In both cases, enter the word "*user*". After logging in, wait a while for the server to load.

If you entered your login details incorrectly, you will be able to reset your password. After clicking on the phrase "Forgot password?" and entering the email, the user saved in the database will receive an email with the option to reset the application password.

NOTE: As of January 2024, the Replit platform has changed its hosting policies. The repl.co domains have been moved to replit.dev and will only be available when using the editor. This means that the server does not start automatically after logging in to the application. For this reason, NotesApp is currently hosted on the Heroku platform.
